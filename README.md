A properly designed database is the foundation for efficient and effective data management. It is a critical asset for any organization that relies on data to drive its operations.Â 
This project is going into details how I designed a **Booking System Database** for a Sports complex and how I automate activities in the database.

## ðŸŸ¢ Project Overview
---

The aim of this project is to develop a comprehensive database system to manage the booking process of a sports complex, including facilities such as tennis courts, badminton courts, multi-purpose fields, and an archery range. Additionally, automate booking processes, including payments, updating member records, and providing a seamless experience for registered users.

### Key Features
The booking system should contain the following key features:
- The sports complex has the following facilities: 2 tennis courts, 2 badminton courts, 2 multi-purpose fields and 1 archery range.
- Each facility can be booked for a duration of one hour.
- Only registered users are authorized to make bookings.
- Only members who have made full payments are allowed to terminate their membership
- No two members can book the same facility on the same date and time.Â 
- Users can cancel their bookings. Cancellations are allowed up to the day prior to the booked date.
